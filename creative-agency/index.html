                <br>
                The first step in installing rack mount LCD monitors is to get out and get one. They are available at most any home office or electronics store. Since the rack mounts are becoming more popular, they are easier to find now then aver before.

                The first step will be to install the slides on your desk. Some rack mounting sets will include slides that are “handed.” That means that each slide is assigned a side of the monitor rack, but there are also sets where either slide can go on either side. Consult the instructions with your set to make sure you have mounted them correctly.</p>
